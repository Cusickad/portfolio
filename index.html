<h2>A Love Story Seven Years in the Making</h2>
<p>
  It was the end of October, 2013.  Two strangers met under improbable circumstances at a Halloween party.  He was an ace attorney.  She was a bee.  He was bored and about to leave.  She was also bored, so her friend poked him in the face and introduced them.  Seven and a half years later, they're (finally) getting married.
</p>
<p>And now, Adam and Michelle invite you to share a special moment with them in this one-night-only premiere. You'll gasp in amazement at how beautiful Michelle looks in her dress in the middle of a beautiful ceremony.  You'll give Adam a pity chuckle as he makes terrible wedding-themed jokes throughout the reception.  You will be inspired by their love.  </p>
<h3>One Great Party</h3>
<p>
  While the ceremony is the important part, everyone knows that the reception is the fun part.  Enjoy a live jazz trio while you imbibe at the pre-reception cocktail hour.  Take in the art-deco stylings of the terraced theatre-turned-hall.  Enjoy a quality meal with quality company.  Later on, get down to the groove of DJ Young Man Legend.  Top off the night with even more food as we bring you late-night snacktion, a coffee bar, and the fabled dessert onslaught.  This is a party you won't want to miss.
